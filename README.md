## How The Web Speech API Works

The Web Speech API is a JavaScript API that allows voice data to be incorporated into web applications. It consists of two components: speech recognition and speech synthesis.

### Speech Recognition

The SpeechRecognition interface of the Web Speech API is used to control the recognition service and recognize speech in the browser.

```javascript   
const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
recognition.lang = "en-US";
recognition.interimResults = false;
recognition.maxAlternatives = 1;
recognition.start();
```
